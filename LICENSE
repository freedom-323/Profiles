General Project Attribution Notice (GPAN)

Copyright (c) 2026 freedom-323

-- General principles --

This repository is licensed simultaneously under the MIT License and the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 (MPL 2.0). Use, copying, modification, distribution, and sublicensing are permitted only under the terms of both licenses taken together; recipients must comply with LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL.

If any provision of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, CREDITS, or any other license, notice, or additional terms applied to any copy or distribution of this repository conflicts with this GPAN, this GPAN shall govern to the extent permitted by applicable law. If LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL conflict, MPL 2.0 shall govern to the extent of that conflict.

Order of precedence for conflicting terms:

1. This GPAN
2. The CREDITS file (including the required promotional statement and original credits content, and any permitted fork credits appended under a clearly labeled section)
3. Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)
4. MIT License
5. Any additional license(s) applied by a fork owner

freedom-323 may publish explanations, interpretations, or edits to this GPAN; those materials are binding only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

-- "Repository" and "fork" definitions --

"Repository" means the original project repository and any official distributions derived directly from it, including source, release artifacts, packaged binaries, installers, container images, release archives, and related files published as official project releases.

"Fork" means a copy or redistribution of this repository (or a substantial portion) published by a third party under a different project name, repository, or distribution channel. A fork does not include private local copies not distributed outside the forking party’s organization, or contributions submitted back to the original repository for incorporation.

-- Required preserved files --

The repository root must include, and downstream copies must preserve verbatim, the following files:

- LICENSE (this file)
- CREDITS (the project credits and the required promotional statement)
- LICENSE-MIT (the full MIT license text for this repository)
- LICENSE-MPL (the full MPL 2.0 license text for this repository)

CREDITS must contain the original project credits and the required promotional statement. Forks may append permitted fork credits in a clearly labeled section such as "Additional credits" or "Fork additions"; entries added by forks in that section are considered part of CREDITS for the purposes of preservation and the promotional statement.

Translations of preserved files are allowed for convenience only; the verbatim English-language texts in the repository root are authoritative.

Removal or alteration of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, LICENSE (this file), or the original contents of CREDITS, or omission of the required promotional statement, is a material breach and may result in revocation or termination of license rights for the noncompliant copy or distribution and/or other remedies.

-- Permitted additions by fork owners --

Fork owners may append attribution and may add license(s) subject to these rules:

- Appended entries must be added only as new entries and must not remove, alter, relocate, or be placed before any preserved license file or the original CREDITS block.
- Appended entries must appear in a clearly labeled CREDITS section such as "Additional credits" or "Fork additions."
Each appended entry should include the forking party's name and the date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Additional license(s) may be attached by the fork owner provided they do not remove, alter, or conflict with the preserved files or original CREDITS entries.
- Preservation of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, LICENSE (this file), and the original CREDITS contents is mandatory.

Placement of appended license text that precedes, obscures, substitutes for, or otherwise displaces required preserved files will be treated as noncompliance and is subject to the 30‑day cure period below.

-- License-order declaration by fork owners --

A fork owner may specify the desired order or placement of any additional license(s) they attach by adding a plainly named file at the repository root (for example, LICENSE-ADDED or LICENSE-ORDER). That file should list the additional license(s) and the order in which they should be presented or included in the fork’s release artifacts.

Such a license-order declaration applies only to the fork owner’s added license(s) and their forked distribution; it does not modify, replace, or supersede the original preserved files (LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL) or the original contents of CREDITS. The preserved files and original CREDITS content must remain present and unaltered, and must not be obscured by appended license(s) or their presentation.

If a fork owner’s license-order declaration would, in practice, place added license text so as to precede, obscure, substitute for, or otherwise displace any required preserved file or original CREDITS entry, that placement will be treated as noncompliance and is subject to the thirty (30) day cure period described in this GPAN.

-- Permitted commercial distribution --

Commercial sale or other for‑profit distribution of this repository or official release artifacts is permitted only by parties who satisfy all of the following:

1. They have published a fork that conforms to this GPAN (including preservation of required files and CREDITS structure).
2. They have appended their identity and the addition date to CREDITS under a clearly labeled "Additional credits" or "Fork additions" section.
3. Their fork includes demonstrable modifications beyond a verbatim copy and meets these objective criteria:
   - At least three (3) commits authored by the distributor that modify the repository (code, documentation, packaging, or           
configuration);
   - A CHANGELOG or release notes file included in the fork that (a) summarizes the changes, (b) lists commit SHAs or a commit 
range, and (c) is included with the tagged release; and
   - A tagged release (for example, a Git tag using semantic versioning or a dated tag) that contains the CHANGELOG/release notes  
and the modified artifacts.

A distributor offering for sale a verbatim copy of an official release or of the repository that does not meet the objective criteria above is not a permitted commercial distributor. Sale of unchanged/unaltered copies is prohibited under this GPAN.

Permitted commercial distributors who comply with these conditions may lawfully sell their fork or distributions. Distributors who offer copies for commercial sale without meeting these conditions are in breach and must cure as described below.

-- 30‑day cure period --

If a fork or distributor fails to preserve required files, omits the required promotional statement, fails to meet the demonstrable‑changes requirement, or otherwise violates preservation, attribution, or permitted‑distribution rules, the distributor has thirty (30) days from first public publication or first public offering to cure the noncompliance. During this period the distributor must:

a) Restore the required files and make corrections in the repository and distributed artifacts (including restoring LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, and the original CREDITS entries as applicable); and
b) Where practicable, notify freedom-323 by email or by adding a brief note in the distributor's repository describing the corrections and the date they were made.

Failure to cure within thirty (30) days is a material breach and may result in revocation or termination of license rights for that fork or distribution and/or other remedies.

-- No responsibility for purchasers of noncompliant copies --

freedom-323 is not responsible for third parties who purchase or otherwise obtain copies of the repository from distributors who failed to comply with this GPAN. Purchasers of noncompliant copies should seek resolution from the distributor; a sale by a noncompliant party does not change the license status of a copy distributed in breach of this GPAN.

-- Required promotional statement --

Any promotional materials (documentation, websites, advertisements, product "About" screens, and other public descriptions) that mention the functionality or use of this repository must include the following statement verbatim:

"This product contains software developed or released by freedom-323, the project’s contributors, and any individual or organization listed in the 'Credits' section of this repository."

Forks may add their own names and attribution entries in CREDITS under a clearly labeled section such as "Additional credits" or "Fork additions." Names listed in CREDITS (including entries added by forks in the allowed section) are covered by and referenced in the promotional statement above. Fork owners who add credited parties do not need to modify the original promotional statement; inclusion of their names in CREDITS satisfies the promotional-statement requirement.

-- Implementation notes --

- Preserve the promotional statement verbatim in all copies and distributions.
- In promotional materials, it is acceptable to keep the promotional statement verbatim and separately list additional credited parties (for example, an "Additional credits" page), or to include the promotional statement plus an explicit listing of the additional credited parties drawn from CREDITS.
- Failure to include the verbatim promotional statement in promotional materials is subject to the 30‑day cure period.

(For full license texts and details, see LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL at the repository root.)
