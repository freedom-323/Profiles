General Project Attribution Notice (GPAN)

Copyright (c) 2026 freedom-323

-- General principles --

This repository is licensed simultaneously under the MIT License and the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 (MPL 2.0). Use, copying, modification, distribution, and sublicensing are permitted only under the terms of both licenses taken together; recipients must comply with the obligations of both LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL.

If any provision of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, or any other license, notice, or additional terms applied to any copy, portion, or distribution of this repository conflicts with this General Project Attribution Notice (GPAN), the provisions of this GPAN shall govern and prevail. If LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL conflict with each other, the MPL 2.0 shall govern to the extent of that conflict.

-- Copies, notices, and preservation of license texts and credits --

The repository root must include the following files, and their contents must be preserved verbatim in all copies or substantial portions of this repository and in any distributed documentation, packaging, or product "About" or credits screens:

LICENSE (this file)
LICENSE-MIT (the full MIT license text for this repository)
LICENSE-MPL (the full MPL 2.0 license text for this repository)
CREDITS (the project credits and the required promotional statement)
The copyright notice above, this dual-license statement, and the exact contents of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, and CREDITS (including the required promotional statement) must appear verbatim in all copies or substantial portions of this repository and in any distributed documentation, packaging, or product "About" or credits screens. Removal or alteration of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, or CREDITS, or omission of the required promotional statement, constitutes a material breach and may result in revocation or termination of license rights for the non‑complying copy or distribution and/or other legal remedies.

-- Definition of "fork" --

For this notice, a "fork" means any copy or redistribution of this repository (or any substantial portion of it) that is published or made available by a third party under a different project name, repository, or distribution channel. Examples include, but are not limited to:

Creating a new public or private repository that begins with a copy of this repository’s content and is maintained separately from the original;
Publishing a derived distribution (source or binary) that contains a substantial portion of this repository’s files under a different project name, namespace, or packaging; and
Rehosting or mirroring the repository where the new host treats the copy as a distinct project (for example, by providing separate issue tracking, release tags, or distribution packaging).
A fork does not include simple local copies made solely for private backup, personal experimentation, or internal development that are not distributed outside the forking party’s organization, nor does it include pull requests, patches, or contributions submitted back to the original repository for incorporation by the original maintainers (which remain contributions, not forks, provided the primary repository stays authoritative).

-- Permitted additions by fork owners --

Fork owners and downstream redistributors may append their own attribution information, subject to these rules:

Additions must be appended only as new entries. Do not remove, alter, or relocate any existing entries in CREDITS, the required promotional attribution line, or any preserved license file (LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL).
Appended entries must appear in a clearly labeled section of CREDITS titled "Additional credits", "Fork additions", or similar, separated from the original credits block.
Each appended entry must include the forking party's name (person or organization) and the date of the addition in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
Preservation of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, LICENSE (this file), and the original contents of CREDITS is mandatory; removal or alteration of those files or original entries constitutes a material breach.
Permitted additions that comply with these rules do not constitute a breach and are allowed without further permission from the original authors.

-- 30‑day cure period --

If a fork is published that initially omits or misplaces required preserved files or otherwise fails to comply with the preservation, attribution, or CREDITS-addition rules, the fork owner has thirty (30) days from the date of first public publication of that fork to cure the noncompliance. During this period the fork owner must:

a) Restore the required files and make any corrections in the fork repository and in distributed artifacts (including restoring LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, and the original CREDITS entries where applicable); and
b) Where practicable, notify freedom-323 by email or by adding a short note in the fork's repository describing the corrections and the date they were made.

Failure to cure within thirty (30) days will be treated as a material breach and may result in revocation or termination of license rights for that fork or distribution and/or other legal remedies.

-- Required attribution in promotional materials --

Any promotional materials (including documentation, websites, advertisements, and other public descriptions) that mention the functionality or use of this repository must include the following statement verbatim:

"This product contains software developed or released by freedom-323, his contributors, and any individual or organization mentioned in the 'Credits' section of this repository."
