General Project Attribution Notice (GPAN)

Copyright (c) 2026 freedom-323

-- General principles --

This repository is licensed simultaneously under the MIT License and the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 (MPL 2.0). Use, copying, modification, distribution, and sublicensing of the code in this repository are permitted only under the terms of both licenses taken together; recipients must comply with the obligations of both LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL.

If any provision of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, CREDITS, or any other license, notice, or additional terms applied to any copy, portion, or distribution of this repository conflicts with this General Project Attribution Notice (GPAN), the provisions of this GPAN shall govern and prevail. If LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL conflict with each other, the MPL 2.0 shall govern to the extent of that conflict.

For avoidance of doubt, the order of precedence for conflicting terms is:

1. This GPAN;
2. The CREDITS file (including required promotional statement and original credits content);
3. The Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0);
4. The MIT License; and
5. Any additional license(s) applied by a fork owner.

freedom-323 retains the right to explain, interpret, and edit this GPAN at any time without prior notice. Explanations, interpretations, or edits published by freedom-323 are binding on recipients to the extent permitted by applicable law.

-- Definition of "repository" --

For the purposes of this GPAN, "repository" means the original project repository and any official distributions derived directly from it, and includes source code, release artifacts, packaged binaries, installers, container images, release archives, and any other software or related files published by the project maintainers as official project releases or distributions.

-- Definition of "fork" --

For this notice, a "fork" means any copy or redistribution of this repository (or any substantial portion of it) that is published or made available by a third party under a different project name, repository, or distribution channel. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Creating a new public or private repository that begins with a copy of this repository’s content and is maintained separately from the original;
- Publishing a derived distribution (source or binary) that contains a substantial portion of this repository’s files under a different project name, namespace, or packaging; and
- Rehosting or mirroring the repository where the new host treats the copy as a distinct project (for example, by providing separate issue tracking, release tags, or distribution packaging).

A fork does not include simple local copies made solely for private backup, personal experimentation, or internal development that are not distributed outside the forking party’s organization, nor does it include pull requests, patches, or contributions submitted back to the original repository for incorporation by the original maintainers (which remain contributions, not forks, provided the primary repository stays authoritative).

-- Copies, notices, and preservation of license texts and credits --

The repository root must include the following files, and their contents must be preserved verbatim in all copies or substantial portions of this repository and in any distributed documentation, packaging, or product "About" or credits screens:

LICENSE (this file)
CREDITS (the project credits and the required promotional statement)
LICENSE-MIT (the full MIT license text for this repository)
LICENSE-MPL (the full MPL 2.0 license text for this repository)

Translations of any preserved file (LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, or CREDITS) are permitted for convenience or reference only, but such translations are non‑authoritative. The verbatim English-language texts of the preserved files as included in the repository root are the controlling authoritative versions; translations must not replace, alter, or be presented as the definitive text for legal or compliance purposes.

The copyright notice above, this dual-license statement, and the exact contents of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, and CREDITS (including the required promotional statement) must appear verbatim in all copies or substantial portions of this repository and in any distributed documentation, packaging, or product "About" or credits screens. Removal or alteration of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, or CREDITS, or omission of the required promotional statement, constitutes a material breach and may result in revocation or termination of license rights for the non‑complying copy or distribution and/or other legal remedies.

-- Permitted additions by fork owners --

Fork owners and downstream redistributors may append their own attribution information and may include additional license(s), subject to these rules:

1. Additions must be appended only as new entries. Do not remove, alter, relocate, or place any appended entry above or before any preserved license file (LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL) or the original contents of CREDITS.
2. Appended entries must appear in a clearly labeled section of CREDITS titled "Additional credits", "Fork additions", or similar, separated from the original credits block.
3. Each appended entry should include the forking party's name (person or organization) and the date of the addition in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
4. Fork owners may attach one or more additional license(s) to their fork or to distributions derived from it; any additional license(s) may be preserved by the fork owner in the fork or in release artifacts so long as preservation does not remove, alter, or conflict with the required preserved files (LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL) or the original contents of CREDITS.
5. Preservation of LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, LICENSE (this file), and the original contents of CREDITS is mandatory; removal or alteration of those files or original entries constitutes a material breach.

Placement of an additional license that precedes, obscures, substitutes for, or otherwise displaces any required preserved file or original CREDITS entry will be treated as noncompliance and is subject to the thirty (30) day cure period described below.

Permitted additions that comply with these rules do not constitute a breach and are allowed without further permission from the original authors.

-- 30‑day cure period --

If a fork is published that initially omits or misplaces required preserved files or otherwise fails to comply with the preservation, attribution, or CREDITS-addition rules (including placement of additional licenses in a manner that precedes, obscures, substitutes for, or displaces required preserved materials), the fork owner has thirty (30) days from the date of first public publication of that fork to cure the noncompliance. During this period the fork owner must:

a) Restore the required files and make any corrections in the fork repository and in distributed artifacts (including restoring LICENSE, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-MPL, and the original CREDITS entries where applicable); and
b) Where practicable, notify freedom-323 by email or by adding a short note in the fork's repository describing the corrections and the date they were made.

The thirty (30) day cure period also applies specifically to omission of the required promotional statement from CREDITS or from any promotional materials or packaging. Failure to add the required promotional statement within thirty (30) days of first public publication of the fork or distribution will be treated as a material breach.

Failure to cure within thirty (30) days will be treated as a material breach and may result in revocation or termination of license rights for that fork or distribution and/or other legal remedies.

-- Required attribution in promotional materials --

Any promotional materials (including documentation, websites, advertisements, and other public descriptions) that mention the functionality or use of this repository must include the following statement verbatim:

"This product contains software developed or released by freedom-323, his contributors, and any individual or organization mentioned in the 'Credits' section of this repository."
